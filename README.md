# Fullstack Coding Challenge

## Overview ##
The goal of this challenge is to create a NFT gallery webapp.

## Requirements ##
- Make sure that the webapp is performant and feels pleasant to use
- User should be able to view all NFTs for an address (bonus points, also allow for ENS)
- User should be able to "like" a NFT
- User should be able to see the like count for a NFT
- README file in the repo that answer the following questions
  1. What is your testing strategy? (There's no need for you to add testing but feel free to if you'd like!). If manual what are the test cases, if automated how would you go about doing it?
  2. How did you decide on how to organize and architect the webapp?
  3. What are some design decisions that you made that we should be aware of?
  4. What are the instructions for getting your submission running?

## Notes ##
- No need to focus on authentication for this project (feel free to if you'd like to though!)
- To get NFT data please do one of the following
  1. Use opensea API
  2. Use alchemy NFT API
  3. Use moralis NFT API
  4. Use any other NFT API you can find
  5. Feel free to mock NFT data to pass back
- A user can like a NFT as many times as they want (since no need to focus on authentication :))
- This is an open-ended challenge and the goal is to show off your skills and strengths. Feel free to pay attention to the areas that you want and just note that in the write up. If you want to do everything in the webapp, feel free to do so. If you'd rather create a more robust api and a simple frontend, feel free to do that as well!
- No need to focus on deployment or anything, please just add instructions on how to run locally
